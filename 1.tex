A \textit{Poll} is when a person goes out and randomly select people from a large population to form a sample, and study that sample to figure out what the larger population wants.

    Drawing conclusions about a larger population based on a relatively small sample.

\textbf{Point Estimation}: Estimating a quantity of interest in the larger population.

\subsubsection*{What is the average height of all adult males in France?}
In order to estimate the average height of all adult males in France, we first took a sample of 10 adult males and measured their heights. Below is a histogram of the heights of 10 adult males in France. The x axis is the height in cm in bins and the y axis is the density. Density is a number such that the total area of each bar is going to represent the proportion of the people in our sample that we saw in the corresponding bin.

\textbf{Density}: It is a number such that the total area of each bar is going to represent the proportion of the people in our sample that we saw in the corresponding bin.

For 1 million samples, the Histogram is going to take the shape of a bell curve. \textbf{This represents perfect information} i.e. the sample is representative of the population or a model for the idealized population.

\subsection{Population Mean $\mu$ and Sample Mean $\bar{X}$}

$\mu$ is the average in an ideal population. It is no the sample average.

Because of the symmetry of the Bell curve, the true average height $\mu$ is going to be the peak of the histogram.

If i take many samples of size 100 and compute the sample mean $\bar{X}$, they are going to pile up and make a \textbf{sampling distribution}. We use the sampling distribution to estimate the true mean $\mu$.
